Simple examples of in-built functions are seq(), mean(), max(), sum(x) and paste(...) etc. 
They are directly called by user written programs.
We can create user-defined functions in R. 
They are specific to what a user wants and once created they can be used like the built-in functions. 
Below is an example of how a function is created and used.:
new.function <- function(a) {
   for(i in 1:a) {
      b <- i^2
      print(b)
     
     (2) The statement given below is true
     
     3(a)False
      (b)True
      (c)False
      (d)True
